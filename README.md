Customer Satisfaction Prediction – Machine Learning Project

🧠 Overview
A Data Science project that predicts customer satisfaction based on service ticket data using **Machine Learning** and **Natural Language Processing**.  
It also includes detailed **visual analytics (EDA)** and feature importance insights.

🚀 Features
- ✅ Data cleaning and preprocessing  
- 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis with 15+ plots  
- 🤖 Machine Learning Models: Random Forest, Logistic Regression  
- 💬 NLP Extension using TF-IDF + Logistic Regression  
- 🔍 Feature importance and model evaluation  
- 🎨 Advanced visualizations (Box, Violin, Area, Heatmap, Pair, Strip plots)

🧩 Tech Stack
**Languages:** Python  
**Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn  
**IDE:** Jupyter Notebook / VS Code  
**Dataset Source:** [Customer Support Ticket Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/)  


🧮 Workflow
1. **Data Preprocessing:** Clean, encode, and scale dataset  
2. **EDA:** Identify trends, correlations, and customer segments  
3. **Model Building:** Train ML models for satisfaction prediction   
4. **Evaluation:** Assess accuracy and visualize results  

📊 Results
| Model | Accuracy |
|--------|-----------|
| Random Forest | ~90% |
| Logistic Regression | ~84% |

 📈 Visualizations
Includes:
- Box Plot, Violin Plot  
- Area Plot, KDE Plot  
- Pair Plot, Heatmap  
- Count Plot, Strip Plot  
- Histogram  

💡 Key Insights
- Customers aged **31–40** are most satisfied.  
- **Refund and critical priority** tickets have the lowest ratings.  
- **Quick responses** lead to higher satisfaction.  
- **Chat support** channels perform best overall.


🏁 Future Work
